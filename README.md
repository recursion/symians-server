# symians
A websocket server using es6 express, and socket.io.
The server depends on a client being in the /public directory.
Since the client is also under development it is symlinked from 
its current build directory.

#### Usage:
`npm run serve` - lints, tests, and then runs the server
`npm run serve-dev` - runs the server with watches on src
`npm run test-dev` - run tests 
`npm run test` - run tests 
`npm run lint` - run linting
